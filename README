Implementation of homework 2, Dungeon Load/Save.

All the features added were implemented on my source code from homework 1, 
Dungeon Generation.

New header file: rooms.h -- variable controlling room array size.

The new features can be divided into three different categories, switches input,
a save feature, and a load feature.

The user switch input is straightforward, "--save" and "--load" are the only
two available switches, and input can be one, the other, or both switches.

"--save"
A new dungeon is generated from the application and saved to disk.

"--load"
The dungeon saved in disk is loaded into the application.

"--save --load" or "--load --save"
Load dungeon saved in disk into application and write it to disk.

dungeon file format:
semantic(12 bytes)+version(1 byte)+size(1 byte)+hardness(21*80 bytes)+
rooms(4*numRooms bytes)
