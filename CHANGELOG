Assignment 1.02:

**IMPORTANT***
I created a new header file, "rooms.h".
It only contains an initialized int variable which controls the room array size
in the application.

01/29: Changed the way I set the absolute path of the dungeon file. Before, it
was getenv() was saved to a pointer, which could lead to OS environment 
complications. Implemented the logic for loading first--based my implementation off of the example dungeon files. Implemented the logic for saving.

01/27: Implemented the logic for handling application switches. Very
straightforward switch case implementation handled in the main function.

01/25: Created the directory for dungeon files and created the string variable
with the absolute path to the dungeon file in C.

Assignment 1.01:

01/17: Not a whole lot to say here. I coded the entire thing in one sitting :)
I implemented the room generation, the utility to check if a generated room is
valid, and a very linear way of connecting all the rooms on the map.

01/18: I felt like my corridors were far too linear, therefore I talked to
Dr. Sheaffer to point me in the right direction as to how to decrease linearity.
I implemented the corridor generation to have a 30% probability to shift left
or right when building up a column.
I am satisfied with my dungeons now :)
